After reviewing the content of the notebook, I can summarize its operation as follows: The code begins by loading and examining an electric vehicle (EV) pricing dataset from a CSV file using `pandas`, creating a DataFrame to visualize its structure. Then, it performs data preprocessing, checking for missing values and cleaning them if necessary. It defines the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target, the EV prices to be predicted), and categorical data is converted into numerical form using methods like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding. The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using `train_test_split`. A decision tree model, likely `DecisionTreeRegressor` or `DecisionTreeClassifier`, is then trained on the data, and predictions are made on the test set. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using metrics like `mean_squared_error` or `accuracy_score`, and the tree structure is visualized using the `plot_tree` function. Let me know if you need a more detailed explanation of any specific part of the code!
